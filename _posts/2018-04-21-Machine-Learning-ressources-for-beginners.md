Hello everyone, this post is a compilation of useful ressources for those who want to dig into Machine Learning techniques.
Enjoy !

In the field of Machine Learning and Data Science as a whole, you first need to get solid basics in mathematics (linear algebra, statistics/probabilities and mathematical optimization are at play here).

# I ) Notions en mathématiques

For notions in probabilities and statistics, I highly recommend these two courses !

* [link](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/course-v1:OLI+ProbStat+Open_Jan2017/info)
* [link](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesSciences/StatLearning/Winter2016/info) (refers to the excellent ***Introduction to Statistical Learning*** [link](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) book).

I refer you to this article which reprises what to learn in math for data science : 
[link](https://elitedatascience.com/learn-math-for-data-science)

In fact, you could easily begin you learning with the courses referenced thereafter which go into the heart of the matter, without having compiled all the previous ressources, because the courses are adressed to beginners and little refreshers as for the mathematical aspects will be given. I therefore recommend you the following courses, if you have some mathematical background, and to refer to the previous contents if you need to freshen up your memory.

As for deep learning, if you want to directly begin with this particular field of techniques without heading into Machine Learning or Data Science, you can get on by with knowledge in linear algebra and optimization.

# II ) Online courses ( MOOC )

* [link](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science) : This course is an introduction to Data Science with Python coding language. It would be really useful for you to get a good grasp of **Python** as well as **R** languages which are used plenty in data science and machine learning.



The two main courses I recommend you are *Andrew Ng's* (AI researcher and former professor at Stanford (he has, amongst other things, worked for *Google* and *Baidu* in this field) coursera MOOCS ! Andrew is really pedagogue in his teaching and his courses are a really great asset in anyone's learning path.

* Deep Learning : [link](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)


PS : You can access the course contents for free by clicking on free attendance when you subscribe to each course individually.

### Great news ! New AI learning platform

Google has recently launched a AI learning platform : [link](https://ai.google/education/#?modal_active=none) (friendly visualisations are involved to understand math concepts).

# III) Data Communities

Nothing is better than doing projects to learn data science, I recommend you Kaggle projects (it's a web platform designed to host competitions dealing with data science. Companies can host competitions while offering prizes for the winners), try out the "knowledge competition" first, which are meant for learning purposes : 

* A tutorial about Titanic dataset from Kaggle : [link](https://www.datacamp.com/community/open-courses/kaggle-python-tutorial-on-machine-learning)
* « Getting started » competitons on Kaggle :[link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions?sortBy=grouped&group=general&page=1&pageSize=20&category=gettingStarted)
* A really great free mean to learn how to buils ml models : [link](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview)



Les communautés data science sont nombreuses sur meetup.com, des meetups sont souvent organisés sur Paris. (n’hésitez pas à voir mes groupes sur mon profil et vous inscrire aux prochains meetups qui vous intéressent : [link](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/Paris-Datageeks/members/199484445/))

There also are many Facebook groups or even Twitter or Quora feeds which deal with discussions revolving around data science.

# IV) Ressources complémentaires

* A great repository by Shujian Lu with categorized ressources : [link](https://github.com/Shujian2015/FreeML) 

* a data science *stackoverflow* : [link](https://www.kdnuggets.com/) 

* great content (again) : [link](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/)

I hope this post was useful to you, many ressources are available on the internet, go on and do some data projects yourself ! :) 

## Happy Learning !
