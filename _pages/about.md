Hello everyone ! I am currently as Software Engineer in Machine Learning at Orange labs. I graduated from ENSIIE (Engineering School in Computer Science), 
one of the top Engineering School in France and also hold a degree in Data Science and Big Data from Universit√© Paris-Saclay.

Curious, with an analytical mindset and a passion for discovery, I chose to embrace Data Science as a career path.

Interests : english books & lit (SCI-FI, anticipation novels), meetups (ML/AI), competitions (startup ideas, innovation challenges), moocs (data science, big data and machine learning, sciences & art). 

Feel free to get in touch !
